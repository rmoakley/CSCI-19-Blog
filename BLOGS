TryHackMe Room 2 "Intro to LAN"
CSCI-19 Module 3
  
   Summary: 
   The room this week improved our understanding of the different LAN topologies, subnetting, as well as the different networking protocols such as ARP 
   and DHCP. However, it also briefly covered topics such as IP addressing, routers, and switches. This room was full of useful, fundamental 
   information regarding basic networking concepts. I found the sections on subnetting as well as ARP and DHCP to be the most informative; As these 
   are protocols I have seen before using wireshark. Though, at the time I was unaware of what their function were. 
       
   A Closer Look:
   The first lesson in the room covers the various forms of topologies seen in real-world LANs. Such as ring, BUS, and star topologies. It covers the 
   different pros and cons attributed to each topology, as well as their relevance in modern networks. First, the room addresses star topologies,
   depicting how all the devices are connected to a central switch or hub. Then, it discusses how a ring topology connects all the devices
   together with cables so that data flows from device to device to its destination. Then, finally, it talks about the BUS topology and how the devices 
   are connected to a central cable or "backbone".
   
   Then the room goes into detail about subnetting and how it may be ideal to split one large network into multiple smaller ones that communicate with 
   each other. It explains a little about IP addressing and how it relates to the subnet, more specifically, how subnets use IP addresses to 
   communicate on a network. Key terms such as network addresses, host addresses, and default gateways are also defined and explained. 
   
   Then the room delves into two different protocols, ARP and DHCP. First, it explains the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) and how requests
   and replies are sent between devices on a network. More specifically, how a device sends out an ARP request looking for a specific MAC address of 
   the device it wants to communicate with. Then, how the protocol sends an ARP reply once it's found the device it was looking for. 
   
   The Last protocol to be discussed was the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP). This smaller section depicts the conversation that takes place 
   between a device looking to be configured with an IP address, and the DHCP server. When a device is not configured with an IP address manually, it 
   can use a DHCP server to configure an IP address by sending a DHCP Discover packet. If this discover packet is picked up by the server it sends out 
   a DHCP offer. The computer then sends a DHCP request to the server requesting for that IP address to which the server sends a DHCP Ack packet, and 
   assigns that address to the computer. 
   
  
   Personal Thoughts:
   I thought this room was great, I found the lessons on the subnet as well as ARP and DHCP to be the most interesting parts of the room. The different 
   real-world topologies was also very informative as it is always nice to see examples of what LANs might look like. Overall, this room did a good 
   job at improving my fundamental understanding of networking.

TryHackMe Room 1 "Introductory Networking"
CSCI-19 Module 2

   Summary: 
   This weeks lab introduced us to basic network concepts that are fundemental to our understanding networking and security. The 
   room addressed topics such as OSI, the TCP/IP model, encapsulation, DNS, IP addressing, as well as several beginner networking tools like ping,
   traceroute, WHOIS, and dig.
   
   
   A Closer Look: 
   Introductory Networking provides crucial information on the basics of networking. Beginning with the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model
   where it describes the several layers that form the network as a whole. Going into detail on how the seven layers cooperate together to maintain 
   a network standard for communication. Then the room delves into the concept of encapsulation, more specifically, how data gathers additional 
   information from each layer it passes through. Also, adding how the tranmissions are "de-encapsulated" backwards through the layers when 
   received by the end host. 
   
   Room 1 then goes on to address the additional protocols used in networking and how they align themselves with the OSI model. It also covers a 
   concept known as the "three way handshake" where a client and server need to send a series of SYN, SYN/ACK, and ACK packets in order to connect 
   to each other.
   
   Finally, the room covers several networking tools and how to use them in order to gain crucial information about a network or website. It talks
   about ping and how it can show connectivity to a website or host. The use of traceroute in mapping the path data will take to its destination. 
   Using WHOIS and dig to discover identifing information about a website as well as the server its hosted on, and important OSINT including emails, 
   phone numbers, physical addresses, and more. 
   
   
   Personal Thoughts :
   I've used TryHackMe before and have always found the lessons to be extremely helpful. This room continues that trend with lots of information that 
   I found to be really beneficial for a basic understanding of networking; Hence the name, "Introductory Networking". While I did have prior 
   knowledge about the TCP/IP model, the SYN ACK proccess, as well as most of the tools covered, I was unaware of the several layers that data 
   needs to pass through to reach its destination as well as the process of encapsulation. The room did a really good job at covering the basics and I 
   would recommend it to anyone who is just starting in networking.
