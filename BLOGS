TryHackMe Room 1 "Introductory Networking"
CSCI-19 Module 2

   Summary : 
   This weeks lab introduced us to basic network concepts that are fundemental to our understanding networking and security. The 
   room addressed topics such as OSI, the TCP/IP model, encapsulation, DNS, IP addressing, as well as several beginner networking tools like ping,
   traceroute, WHOIS, and dig.
   
   
   Synopsis : 
   Introductory Networking provides crucial information on the basics of networking. Beginning with the OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model
   where it describes the several layers that form the network as a whole. Going into detail on how the seven layers cooperate together to maintain 
   a network standard for communication. Then the room delves into the concept of encapsulation, more specifically, how data gathers additional 
   information from each layer it passes through. Also, adding how the tranmissions are "de-encapsulated" backwards through the layers when 
   received by the end host. 
   
   Room 1 then goes on to address the additional protocols used in networking and how they align themselves with the OSI model. It also covers a 
   concept known as the "three way handshake" where a client and server need to send a series of SYN, SYN/ACK, and ACK packets in order to connect 
   to each other.
   
   Finally, the room covers several networking tools and how to use them in order to gain crucial information about a network or website. It talks
   about ping and how it can show connectivity to a website or host. The use of traceroute in mapping the path data will take to its destination. 
   Using WHOIS and dig to discover identifing information about a website as well as the server its hosted on, and important OSINT including emails, 
   phone numbers, physical addresses, and more. 
   
   
   My Thoughts :
   I've used TryHackMe before and have always found the lessons to be extremely helpful. This room continues that trend with lots of information that 
   I found to be really beneficial for a basic understanding of networking; Hence the name, "Introductory Networking". While I did have prior 
   knowledge about the TCP/IP model, the SYN ACK proccess, as well as most of the tools covered, I was unaware of the several layers that data 
   needs to pass through to reach its destination as well as the process of encapsulation. The room did a really good job at covering the basics and I 
   would recommend it to anyone who is just starting in networking
